Title:  ReClaim – A Street Reuse and Community Clean-Up Website
Description: 
ReClaim is a simple community website that helps people share unwanted items left on the street. Residents can take a photo and upload it so others can see and collect useful items. If no one takes the items after a few days, city workers can see the location and remove them. This helps reduce waste and keep neighborhoods clean.
Target Audience:
- City residents, age 20–60, living in urban or suburban areas.
- People who want to give away items instead of throwing them away.
- People who like to reuse or collect free items.
- City cleaning teams and community volunteers.
Purpose:
The website encourages people to reuse old furniture, appliances, and other items that are still usable. It also helps city services respond faster when items stay on the street for too long. The goal is to build cleaner, greener, and more caring communities.

Main Features:
1. Upload Items: Users can take a photo and add details like type, location, and condition.
2. Map View: Shows all available items nearby using color markers.
3. Clean-Up Alerts: When items stay too long, they turn red on the map for city clean-up teams.
4. Community Sharing: People can post comments or thank others for sharing.
5. Resource Page: Offers links to reuse, donation, and recycling websites.

Design:
The website uses simple colors and easy navigation:
- Green for reuse and environment.
- Orange for important buttons.
- White background for clean look.
-Large text and clear buttons help users focus on key actions like “Upload Item” and “Find Nearby.”
Call-to-Action Statement (Optional)
